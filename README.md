MétEX - the Paris Métro Experience
==================================
2005 Version: http://metex.sblorgh.org/
2014 Renewal Version: http://metexv2.sblorgh.org/

MétEX was my final-year project at university. It's a virtual tour of the Paris Métro,
and was originally developed using Flash, ASP.net and using an Access database.

The aim was to develop a dynamic virtual tour system that could easily be modified
to suit various applications.

I since updated the site to use PHP and MySQL, but I believe the time has come to
bring MétEX properly up to date.

MétEX v2 is being developed in HTML5 and CakePHP, losing the Flash front-end and
gaining new features.

This repo contains the full source code for MétEX v2, minus the visual and audio assets.
