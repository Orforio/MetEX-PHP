# MétEX-PHP

This is the original PHP version of my 2014 renewal of MétEX, my university final-year project.

I've since abandoned it in favour of my Ruby on Rails port, which I am actively maintaining. For more information on MétEX, or to report an issue, please visit the current [MetEX Repo](https://github.com/PkerUNO/MetEX).
